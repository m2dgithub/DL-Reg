The codes provided in this directory are related to the last experiment in the manuscript entitled 

"DL-Reg: A Deep Learning Regularization Technique using Linear Regression". However, these codes contain the main parts

of the propoed method, and researchers/developers can simply find the core implementation of DL-Reg. Please see the manuscript file for more details.


To run each code, just simply run its file using python filename.python

-CIFAR10_DL_Reg.py applyies DL-Reg as the regularizer over CIFAR-10
-CIFAR10_WD.py applyies Weight_Decay as the regularizer over CIFAR-10

-MNIST_DL_Reg.py applyies DL-Reg as the regularizer over MNIST
-MNIST_WD.py applyies Weight_Decay as the regularizer over MNIST
